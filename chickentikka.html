<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Chicken tikka masala is usually made with heavy cream, but I like to use
  coconut milk instead; its subtle sweetness works beautifully with the spices
  in the dish. Serve with steamed rice.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>

    Make sauce: Place the skillet with chicken drippings over medium-high heat.
    Stir onion into the skillet; sauté until onion softens and turns
    translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook until paste
    caramelizes, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic and ginger into tomato-onion
    mixture; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pour crushed tomatoes into the skillet. Bring to a boil while scraping the
    browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon.
    Pour in coconut milk and chicken broth; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to
    medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend and sauce
    is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir chicken and any accumulated juices into sauce. Add cilantro and red
    pepper flakes; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until
    chicken is cooked through and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and
    black pepper.
  </li>
</ol>
